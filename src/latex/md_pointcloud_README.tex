This repo is part of the Uni\+TN\textquotesingle{}s project for the course of \char`\"{}\+Fondamenti di Robotica\char`\"{} held by prof. Luigi Palopoli. The scripts in this repo have the goal of identifying the centre and orientation of a mega block in gazebo in order for the U\+R5\textquotesingle{}s end effector to be able to reach the object and grab it.
