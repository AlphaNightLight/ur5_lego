This is a sub module of \href{https://github.com/AlphaNightLight/ur5_lego}{\texttt{ ur5\+\_\+lego}} project that detect and classify mega-\/blocks with Y\+O\+LO v8 fine-\/tuned model. From a given dataset, it elaborates and adapt it to Y\+O\+LO standards. Then uses pre-\/trained model to fine-\/tune the network.
